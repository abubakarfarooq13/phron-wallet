Hello. I'm using a homebrew Substrate client and I'm having issues connecting to the RPC at https://test.azero.dev/
Is there any alternative RPC I could use for the testnet? Or perhaps some testnet validator could share their URL with me?
The issue I'm having is specific to my client: It replaces request origin with null (by design) which is causing a lot of discrimination by web servers et. al. (Cloudflare, CORS, proxies, etc., all may reject this request at some point)
